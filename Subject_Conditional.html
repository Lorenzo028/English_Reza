    <p class="sectionMain">Conditional Sentences</p>
    <p class="sectionTitle">Definitions</p>
    <p class="sectionDesc">Conditional sentences are in the conditional mood (a sub-category of the subjunctive mood), which is used for hypothetical scenarios that are dependent on a certain condition or conditions. They are usually constructed
      using if to identify the conditions that must be met.<br><br></p>
    <p class="sectionTitle">Types</p>
    <p class="sectionDesc">In general,there's four type of conditional sentence: type 0,1,2,& 3,every type has it's own usage and rule,in this lesson we gonna learn all of it to improve your grammar skill.<br><br><span class="sectionSubType">Zero
        Conditional</span><br>A zero conditional sentence uses the present simple tense to talk about what is always or generally true. It is classified as a conditional because it creates a
      hypothetical situation to describe what would be true each time something happens.
      The general structure for the zero conditional is: “If + subject + present tense of predicate verb, subject + present tense of main verb.”<br>For Example:<br>• If you throw ball in the air, it comes back down.<br>• If we get up early, we always
      go jogging.<br><br><span class="sectionSubType">First Conditional:</span><br>The first conditional is very similar in structure to the zero conditional. We still use if plus the present simple to create the condition, except that we now use the
      future simple tense (will + bare infinitive) to describe a probable result of the condition.
      Thus, the structure is: “If + present simple tense, will + infinitive.”<br>For Example:<br>• If i see him, i will tell him about the truth.<br>• If i win the lottery, I will buy a new house.<br>• If i meet her again, I'm gonna confess my
      feeling to her.<br><br><span class="sectionSubType">Second Conditional:</span><br>We use the second conditional to speak about a hypothetical situation or outcome resulting from the condition. Unlike the first conditional, we use the second
      conditional to talk about things that cannot or are unlikely to happen.
      To create the second conditional, we use the past simple tense after the if clause, followed by would + the bare infinitive for the result of the condition.
      In addition to would (which we use to describe something we would definitely do), we can also use could for what we would be able to do, as well as might for what it is possible (but unlikely) we would do.<br>• Please buy the scarf <b>with
        dots.</b> (If you look at this sentence, you will find the noun which is scarf. If there is no use of a prepositional phrase, the noun can be written as a dotted scarf. In this
      case the preposition functions as an adjective.)<br>For Example:<br>• If i went to London, i would visit Trafalagar Square.<br>• If i won the lottery, i could buy a new house.<br><br><span class="sectionSubType">Third
        Conditional:</span><br>Third conditionals are used to establish a hypothetical situation in the past, followed by a hypothetical outcome that did not really happen—typically, the outcome is the opposite of what actually happened.
      To form the third conditional, we use the past perfect tense for the if conditional clause, and would have + the past participle of the verb for the hypothetical outcome.
      (As with the second conditional, we can also use could or might instead of would. Additionally, we can use should have + the past participle to describe an outcome that ought to have happened.)<br>• If i had been more prepared,I would have
      passed that test.<br>• If she had been there, she could have helped you.<br></p>
