    <p class="sectionMain">Prepositional Phrase</p>
    <p class="sectionTitle">Definitions</p>
    <p class="sectionDesc">Prepositional phrases are groups of words containing prepositions. Remember that prepositions are words that indicate the relationships between various elements within a sentence, and you’ll never have difficulty
      identifying prepositional phrases.A prepositional phrase is a group of words that lacks either a verb or a subject, and that functions as a unified part of speech. It normally consists of a preposition and a noun or a preposition and a
      pronoun.Remember the following rules for prepositional phrases and you will find that using them becomes much easier.<br><br>• Prepositional phrases always consist of two basic parts at minimum: the object and the preposition.<br>• In formal
      English, prepositions are almost always followed by objects.<br>• Adjectives can be placed between the prepositions and objects in prepositional phrases.<br>• Prepositional phrases can act as adverbs or adjectives. When they are used as
      adjectives, they modify nouns and pronouns in the same way single-word adjectives do.<br>• When prepositional phrases are used as adverbs, they at the same way single-word adverbs and adverb clauses do, modifying adjectives, verbs, and other
      adverbs.<br><br>Just like bread and cheese are the minimum ingredients for making a cheese sandwich, a preposition and the object of a preposition are the minimum requirements for forming a prepositional phrase. The object of a preposition is
      the name for the noun or pronoun following the preposition.Prepositional phrases don’t have to be plain. Just as adding more ingredients to a sandwich dresses it up, adding more words such as adverbs or adjectives is a good method for spicing
      up prepositional phrases. As you read the following examples of prepositional phrases, you’ll notice that the first sentence in each set contains a basic prepositional phrase, while the second one contains a more interesting one.<br><br></p>
    <p class="sectionTitle">Functions</p>
    <p class="sectionDesc">As we have understood, the prepositional phase is used as an adverb to complete the complete sentence.Apart from that, there are other functions that you need to know about. Among others are:<br><br><span
        class="sectionSubType">As Adverb:</span><br>Prepositions can also function as explaining verbs in sentences.This can be in the form of a time or place statement. Example of sentences:<br>• Lee raised his small mackerel <b>with utmost
        pride.</b><br>•<b>Before the war,</b>Harry play football for Tottenham Hotspur<br>• Dawn is tired <b>from the hike.</b><br><br><span class="sectionSubType">As Adjective:</span><br><br>In its use in sentences, prepositional phrases can also be
      used as adjectives. For example:<br>• Please buy the scarf <b>with dots.</b> (If you look at this sentence, you will find the noun which is scarf. If there is no use of a prepositional phrase, the noun can be written as a dotted scarf. In this
      case the preposition functions as an adjective.)<br>• I just met a girl <b>with blue eyes.</b><br>• Give me one <b>of the red ones.</b><br><br><span class="sectionSubType">As A Subject Pointer:</span><br>Prepositional phrases can also be used
      to refer to the subject in carrying out an activity. For example:<br>• The blood moon is <b>observed by the astronomists.</b><br>• The love letter for Alfin is made <b>by Bima.</b><br>• The rare flower is conserved <b>by the local
        government.</b><br><br><span class="sectionSubType">As a complement to two objects in a sentence:</span><br>In a sentence, of course you often get two objects or multiple objects used.So, this prepositional phrase can be used to separate
      these
      two objects so you don't get confused. For example:<br>• Anjas gave her lunch <b>to the kid on the corner.</b><br>• Reza bought a Nintendo <b>for Faiq.</b><br>• Samantha gives some luxurious bags <b>to her mother.</b></p>
