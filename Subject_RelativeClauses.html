    <p class="sectionMain">Relative Clauses</p>
    <p class="sectionTitle">Definitions</p>
    <p class="sectionDesc">A relative clause is a clause that usually modifies a noun or noun phrase and is introduced by a relative pronoun (which, that, who, whom, whose), a relative adverb (where, when, why), or a zero relative. Also known as an
      adjective clause, an adjectival clause, and a relative construction.Relative clauses always begin with a relative pronoun that replaces a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun when several sentences are combined. What is included in the
      relative pronoun?<br>+ Who: Used to refer to human objects. This pronoun is used to replace the subject noun or pronoun (he, she, we, they).<br>+ Whom: Also used to refer to human objects. This pronoun is used to replace object nouns or
      pronouns (him, her, us, them).<br>+ Whose: Besides who and whom, there is whose which is also used to refer to human objects. This pronoun is used to replace possessive nouns or pronouns (his, hers, our, their).<br>+ That: That can be used to
      refer
      to living objects such as humans, animals and plants and can also be used to replace inanimate objects.<br>+ Which: Which has unique characteristics. Why? Which can be a subject or an object, can be used in non-restrictive relative clauses, and
      can also be used in restrictive relative clauses, although most people don't like to use it.<br><br>The use of relative pronouns can be used as a subject or object in a sentence.<br></p>
